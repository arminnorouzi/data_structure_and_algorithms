    "This Jupyter Notebook focuses on graph and tree data structures and demonstrates various operations that can be performed on them using Python. Graphs and trees are essential for modeling and solving a wide range of real-world problems. This notebook covers the basics of graphs and trees, including their representation, traversal, and common algorithms associated with them. You can run this post in Google Colab using this link:\n",

    "**Graph:** A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting the vertices. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and can have cycles. In graphs, there is no hierarchy, and nodes can have multiple edges connecting them to other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree:** A tree is a data structure in computer science consisting of nodes connected by edges. It is a type of graph but with the restriction that it has a hierarchical structure, meaning that there is a root node with child nodes, each of which may have their own child nodes, and so on. The edges represent the parent-child relationships between the nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph vs. Tree:** The main difference between a tree and a graph is that a tree has a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes, while a graph can have any arrangement of nodes and edges. A search tree is a specific type of tree data structure used for searching and traversing elements, while a graph can be used for many different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search Tree:** A search tree is a specific type of tree data structure used for searching and traversing elements. In a search tree, the arrangement of nodes is based on some specific rules, such as the values of the elements being stored. The nodes are arranged in a way that allows for efficient searching and traversing of elements. Some examples of search trees include binary search trees, AVL trees, and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of search tree is the binary search tree, where each node has at most two children. The elements in a binary search tree are ordered in such a way that for each node, all elements in the left subtree are smaller than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic properties of search trees include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search time: Search trees allow for efficient searching of elements, with an average time complexity of `O(log n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "- Space complexity: Search trees require less memory compared to other data structures like arrays or linked lists, as they store elements in a hierarchical manner.\n",
    "- Insertion and deletion: Search trees allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, with an average time complexity of `O(log n)`.\n",
    "- Ordering: Search trees maintain the order of elements, making it possible to traverse the elements in sorted order.\n",
    "- Balancing: Some search trees, such as AVL trees and red-black trees, are self-balancing, meaning they maintain a balance in the tree even after multiple insertions and deletions. This ensures that the search tree remains efficient even with large numbers of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties make search trees a useful data structure for various applications, such as database indexing, computer graphics, and algorithms for sorting and searching elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** \"Search tree\" and \"binary search tree\" are often used interchangeably to refer to the same type of data structure.\n"

    "BFS, on the other hand, is an iterative algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph or all the nodes of a tree in a breadth-wise manner.

This is because the function uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree, and at each recursion, a new function call is added to the call stack. The maximum number of function calls in the call stack would be equal to the height of the binary tree, so the space complexity is `O(h)`. In the worst case, when the binary tree is a skewed tree, the height of the tree would be equal to the number of nodes in the tree, so the space complexity would be `O(n)`. The time complexity is technically `O(V + E)` where `V` is vortex and `E` is edge, but that equates to `O(n + (n-1)) = O(n)` in binary search tree. This is because all trees have n - 1 edges, n being the number of nodes\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find_max_sum` function is a recursive helper function that helps to find the maximum path sum of a binary tree. It takes a binary tree node as its input and returns a tuple of two values: the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the given node, and the maximum sum that can be achieved by any path in the subtree rooted at the given node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first checks if the given node is None. If it is, it returns a tuple of (0, negative infinity) which indicates that the maximum sum is zero since there are no nodes to include in the path and negative infinity as the maximum sum is initially unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the node is not None, it calls the find_max_sum function recursively on the left and right subtrees of the node. The returned values represent the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the left and right child nodes respectively, as well as the maximum sum that can be achieved in the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the current node. This can be done by finding the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the left or right child node, and adding the value of the current node to it. If the sum is negative, then the current node is not included in the path, so the sum is just the value of the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the maximum sum that can be achieved by any path that includes the current node as the root is calculated. This can be done by adding the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the left child node, the value of the current node, and the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the right child node. This value is then compared to the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path in the left or right subtrees, as well as the previously calculated maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns a tuple of the maximum sum that can be achieved by a path that ends at the current node, and the maximum sum that can be achieved by any path in the subtree rooted at the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space and time complexity**\n",
    "The time complexity of the find_max_sum function is `O(n)`, where n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the function traverses each node in the tree exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the function is `O(log(n))`, where n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls made to traverse the left and right sub-trees of the binary tree. The maximum depth of the call stack is the height of the binary tree, which is log(n) for a balanced binary tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function works by recursively traversing the tree and keeping track of the minimum and maximum possible values that each node can take, based on the values of its parent and ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `validate_bst_helper()` function takes three arguments: the current node, the minimum possible value for the current node, and the maximum possible value for the current node. It returns True if the current node satisfies the conditions for a valid binary search tree, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions for a valid binary search tree are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The value of the current node should be greater than the minimum value for the node, and less than the maximum value for the node.\n",
    "2. The left subtree of the current node should also be a valid binary search tree with a maximum value less than the current node's value.\n",
    "3. The right subtree of the current node should also be a valid binary search tree with a minimum value greater than the current node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these conditions are violated, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it recurses on the left and right subtrees, updating the minimum and maximum values accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main `validate_bst()` function simply calls the `validate_bst_helper()` function with the root of the tree and the minimum and maximum possible values for a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because it visits every node exactly once. The space complexity is `O(d)`, where `d` is the depth of the binary tree, because the function calls itself recursively d times, and each call takes up a certain amount of space on the call stack."

    "The code uses a two-pointer approach to swap the alphabetic characters in the string. The input string is converted to a list of characters so that it can be modified. The left pointer starts at the beginning of the string, and the right pointer starts at the end of the string. The pointers move towards each other until they meet or cross each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, the code checks if the character at the left pointer is alphabetic. If it is not, then the left pointer is incremented to skip over the special character. Similarly, if the character at the right pointer is not alphabetic, then the right pointer is decremented to skip over the special character.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both the left and right pointers point to alphabetic characters, then the characters are swapped using a tuple assignment. After the swap, the left pointer is incremented and the right pointer is decremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pointers have crossed each other, the reversed string is constructed from the modified list using the `join()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and space complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the code is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because the code iterates over each character in the string at most once. The space complexity of the code is `O(n)`, because the input string is converted to a list of characters, which requires `O(n)` extra space.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, the function initializes some variables, including the height and width of the input array, an empty list to store the result, and the starting row and column (which are both set to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then enters a while loop that continues until the end of the array is reached. The loop uses a boolean variable `going_down` to keep track of whether the traversal is currently moving downwards or upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the loop, the function appends the value at the current row and column to the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then checks whether the traversal is currently moving downwards or upwards. **If it's moving downwards, it checks whether it has reached either the last column or the last row of the array**. If it has, it switches the `going_down` variable to False, and adjusts the row and column values accordingly so that the traversal can move upwards. **If it hasn't reached the end of the array, it moves downwards by incrementing the row and decrementing the column**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the traversal is currently moving upwards, the function checks whether **it has reached either the first row or the last column of the array**.

It does this by using two index variables - one starting from the `left` and the other starting from the `right` of the array. The two index variables move towards each other, checking whether the sum of the squares of their corresponding elements is equal to the square of the fixed element or not. If the sum is equal, then the function returns `True` indicating that there is a Pythagorean triplet in the array. If the sum is greater than the square of the fixed element, then the `left` index variable is incremented, and if it is less, then the `right` index variable is decremented. This is because we have sorted the array in descending order and hence the left index variable will always correspond to a smaller number than the right index variable.\n",

    "The function takes an array `array` and a target sum `target_sum` as input, and returns a tuple containing the minimum length of a subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `target_sum`, and the subarray itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "`n` is the length of the input array. `curr_sum` is the current sum of the subarray being considered. `min_len` is initialized to be greater than the length of the input array, so that it can be updated with the length of the shortest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `target_sum`. `start` and `end` are pointers to the beginning and end of the subarray being considered. `start_res` and `end_res` are used to store the starting and ending indexes of the subarray with the smallest length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then enters a while loop, which runs until the end pointer has reached the `end` of the input array. Inside the loop, there are two nested while loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The inner while loop increments the `end` pointer and adds the corresponding element of the input array to the `curr_sum` until the `curr_sum` is greater than or equal to `target_sum`. Once this condition is met, the outer while loop moves on to the next step\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second inner while loop decrements the `start` pointer and subtracts the corresponding element of the input array from the `curr_sum` until the `curr_sum` is less than or equal to `target_sum`. At each step, the function checks if the length of the subarray is smaller than the current minimum length (`min_len`). If it is, the `min_len`, `start_res`, and `end_res` variables are updated to reflect the new shortest subarray. Once the `curr_sum` is less than or equal to `target_sum`, the inner while loop exits and the outer while loop increments the `end` pointer and adds the corresponding element of the input array to the `curr_sum`, starting the process over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the while loop has completed, the function returns a tuple containing the minimum length of a subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `target_sum`, and the subarray itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the function works by maintaining two pointers (`start` and `end`) to a **sliding window** of the input array, and incrementing or decrementing them based on whether the current sum of the window is less than or greater than the target sum `target_sum`. The function keeps track of the shortest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to target_sum, and returns it at the end.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code converts an infix expression to a prefix expression using two stacks. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reverse the infix expression: The first step is to reverse the infix expression. This is because in prefix notation, the operator comes before the operands, whereas in infix notation, the operator comes between the operands. Reversing the infix expression allows us to apply the same logic as in postfix notation, where the operator comes after the operands. For example, the infix is `'(A+B)*(C-D)` and reverse is `)D-C(*)B+A(`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize empty stacks: The code initializes two empty stacks - one for operators and one for operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define operator precedence: The code defines a dictionary that maps each operator to its precedence level. This is used to determine the order in which operators should be added to the prefix expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traverse the infix expression: The code traverses the reversed infix expression from right to left, one character at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current character is an operand: If the current character is an alphabet or a digit, it is pushed onto the operand stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current character is a closing parenthesis: If the current character is a closing parenthesis, it is pushed onto the operator stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current character is an opening parenthesis: If the current character is an opening parenthesis, operators are popped from the operator stack and added to the prefix expression until a closing parenthesis is encountered. The closing parenthesis is then popped and discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current character is an operator: If the current character is an operator, operators are popped from the operator stack and added to the prefix expression until an operator with lower precedence or a closing parenthesis is encountered. The current operator is then pushed onto the operator stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pop the remaining operators: Once the infix expression has been completely traversed, any remaining operators on the operator stack are popped and added to the prefix expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reverse the prefix expression: Finally, the prefix expression is reversed to get the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: When we use the `pop()` method on a list in Python, it removes and returns the last element in the list. In other words, it pops the element from the end of the list. If you want to remove and return an element from a specific position in the list, you can use the `pop(index)` method where index is the position of the element you want to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and space complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the infix expression. This is because each character in the infix expression is processed exactly once. The space complexity of this algorithm is also `O(n)`, since the algorithm uses two stacks of size `n` each.\n",

    "The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is used to find all occurrences of a pattern (substring) in a string (text) efficiently. It was invented by Donald Knuth, Vaughan Pratt, and James H. Morris in 1977. The algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a partial match table, which is then used to perform the matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KMP algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, a partial match table (also called failure function) is built for the pattern. This table stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a proper suffix of the same pattern. The proper prefix of a string is a non-empty prefix that is not equal to the whole string, and the proper suffix is a non-empty suffix that is not equal to the whole string. The table is built in a way that allows it to be used to quickly determine the correct place to resume matching after a mismatch.\n",
    "- Then, the string is matched against the pattern using the partial match table. The matching process starts at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of the pattern. At each step, the algorithm compares the current characters in the string and the pattern. If they match, the algorithm moves on to the next character. If they do not match, the algorithm uses the partial match table to determine the correct place to resume matching. Specifically, the algorithm looks up the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a proper suffix of the substring of the pattern ending at the previous character. This value is used to determine the next character in the pattern to compare against the current character in the string."

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to check if a given substring exists in a given string. The main function is `knuth_morris_pratt_algorithm()`, which takes two arguments: `string` and `substring`. The function returns `True` if the substring is found in string and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of KMP algorithm involves two helper functions: `build_pattern()` and `does_match()`. The `build_pattern()` function constructs a pattern for the substring. This pattern is a list of integers that indicates the positions to start matching characters in substring when a mismatch occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `does_match()` function takes the string, substring and pattern list as arguments. It then uses these to check if the substring exists in the string using the pattern generated by `build_pattern()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of `does_match()` function involves two pointers i and j. The i pointer traverses the string while j pointer traverses the substring. When there is a mismatch between `string[i]` and `substring[j]`, the function uses the pattern list to determine where to start matching characters again. The algorithm continues until either the substring is found in the string or the end of the string is reached."

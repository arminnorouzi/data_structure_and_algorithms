    "# Heap\n",
    "**by Armin Norouzi**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will examine numerous heap algorithms and how they are used in software engineering and computer science. We will go over the key ideas and methods that each software engineer should be familiar with, from heap data structure to heap sort algorithm. Prepare yourself to enter the realm of heaps!\n",

    "## 1. Heap Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The heap property states that for every node $i$ other than the root, the value of the node is at least as large as the value of its parent. This is called a max-heap. A min-heap is defined similarly, except that each node is at least as small as its children. The root of the heap is the largest element in a max-heap and the smallest element in a min-heap. The heap property is listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A min-heap is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller than or equal to its children. This means that the root of the heap is the minimum element in the entire tree, and each subtree rooted at a node also satisfies the heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A max-heap is a complete binary tree where each node is greater than or equal to its children. This means that the root of the heap is the maximum element in the entire tree, and each subtree rooted at a node also satisfies the heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In both cases, the heap property ensures that the minimum or maximum element can be efficiently retrieved from the heap in O(1) time. Additionally, inserting and deleting elements in a heap while maintaining the heap property can be done in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Recap:** A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every level of the tree is completely filled, except possibly for the last level. In the last level, all nodes are aligned as far left as possible. This means that a complete binary tree can be represented as an array, where the root is at index `0`, its children are at indices `1` and `2`, and so on. The parent of a node at index `i` is at index `floor((i-1)/2)`. The children of a node at index `i` are at indices `2i+1` and `2i+2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Recap:** Binary trees are trees in which each node has at most two children. A binary tree is a full binary tree if each node has either zero or two children. A binary tree is a perfect binary tree if all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level. A binary tree is a complete binary tree if all levels except possibly the last are completely filled and all nodes are as far left as possible."

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Heap` class has a constructor that takes in an array of integers and stores them in an instance variable called `heap`. The constructor also calls the `build_heap` method to build the heap from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `build_heap` method builds a min-heap from the array of integers stored in the `heap` instance variable. It does this by calling the `heapify` method on each node in the tree, starting from the last node and working its way up to the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `heapify` method takes in an index `i` and recursively moves the node at index `i` down the tree until the heap property is satisfied. This is done by comparing the node at index `i` with its children. If the node at index `i` is greater than either of its children, then it is swapped with the smaller child. This process is repeated until the node at index `i` is smaller than both of its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `insert` method takes in an integer `x` and inserts it into the heap. It does this by appending `x` to the end of the array and then calling the `heapify` method on the last node in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `extract_min` method removes and returns the minimum element in the heap. It does this by swapping the root of the heap with the last node in the tree, removing the last node, and then calling the `heapify` method on the root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `get_min` method returns the minimum element in the heap. It does this by returning the root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `size` method returns the number of elements in the heap. It does this by returning the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `is_empty` method returns `True` if the heap is empty and `False` otherwise. It does this by checking if the length of the array is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `print_heap` method prints the elements in the heap. It does this by iterating through the array and printing each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `heap_sort` method sorts the elements in the heap. It does this by repeatedly calling the `extract_min` method and appending the result to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `increase_key` method takes in an index `i` and an integer `x` and increases the value of the node at index `i` by `x`. It does this by adding `x` to the node at index `i` and then calling the `heapify` method on the node at index `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `decrease_key` method takes in an index `i` and an integer `x` and decreases the value of the node at index `i` by `x`. It does this by subtracting `x` from the node at index `i` and then calling the `heapify` method on the node at index `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `right` and `left` methods return the indices of the right and left children of a node at index `i`, respectively. They do this by returning `2*i+2` and `2*i+1`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",

This is because it calls the `heapify` method on each node in the tree, starting from the last node and working its way up to the root. The `build_heap` method uses O(n) space, where n is the number of elements in the heap. This is because it creates an array of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `heapify` method runs in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the heap. This is because it compares the node at index `i` with its children and swaps it with the smaller child if necessary. This process is repeated until the node at index `i` is smaller than both of its children. The `heapify` method uses O(1) space, where n is the number of elements in the heap. This is because it does not create any new variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation of code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**First method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We first create a list times that contains the start and end times of each interval. We also include a \"delta\" value of 1 for each start time and -1 for each end time. This will allow us to keep track of how many laptops are in use at any given time.\n",
    "- We sort the times list in increasing order.\n",
    "- We initialize two variables: laptops_in_use (the number of laptops currently in use) and max_laptops (the maximum number of laptops in use at any given time).\n",
    "- We iterate through the times list. For each time interval, we update laptops_in_use by adding or subtracting the delta value. We also update max_laptops to be the maximum of the current value of max_laptops and laptops_in_use.\n",
    "- Finally, we return max_laptops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this method would be `O(n log n)` due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of time intervals. The space complexity would be `O(n)` to store the sorted intervals and the current laptop usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heap method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm first sorts the intervals based on their start times using the built-in `sort` method of Python lists, and then initializes an empty min-heap called laptops to keep track of the `laptops` that are currently available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then iterates through the intervals in the sorted order, and for each interval it checks if there is a laptop available for use. If there is a laptop available (i.e., if the end time of the laptop currently at the top of the heap is less than or equal to the start time of the current interval), the algorithm removes the laptop from the heap using the `heappop` method of the `heapq` module. It then adds the end time of the current interval to the heap using the `heappush` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the iteration, the size of the `laptops` heap represents the minimum number of laptops needed to schedule all the intervals, because the size of the heap corresponds to the maximum number of laptops that are needed simultaneously. This value is returned by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap-based solution has a time complexity of `O(n log k)`, where `k` is the number of available laptops. The space complexity would be `O(k)` to store the laptops in the heap. Therefore, the heap-based solution is more efficient for cases where the number of laptops is much smaller than the number of time intervals."

The algorithm uses a two-dimensional array dp to store intermediate results and improve the efficiency of the solution by avoiding redundant calculations.\n","\n","The `lcs` function is the main function that invokes the `lcs_helper` function to find the LCS. The lcs function first calculates the lengths of the input strings and initializes the dp array with -1 values. The `lcs_helper` function is called with the input strings, their lengths, and the dp array as arguments.\n","\n","The `lcs_helper` function uses a recursive approach to solve the LCS problem. It has base cases for when either of the input strings is empty, in which case it returns `0`. If the value for the current subproblem has already been calculated and stored in the `dp` array, it returns the stored value instead of recalculating it. If the last characters of the two input strings match, the function adds 1 to the LCS length and recursively calls itself with the remaining substrings. If the last characters do not match, the function returns the maximum LCS length of the two substrings without the last characters. The intermediate results are stored in the dp array and can be reused in subsequent calls to improve the overall efficiency of the algorithm.\n","\n","\n","The time complexity of the above code is `O(nm)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm makes nm recursive calls, each of which takes constant time to calculate and store the intermediate results in the dp array. Hence, the total time complexity is `O(nm)`.\n","\n","The space complexity of the code is also `O(nm)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`, respectively. This is because the algorithm uses a two-dimensional array dp to store the intermediate results, and the size of the dp array is `(m+1) * (n+1)`.

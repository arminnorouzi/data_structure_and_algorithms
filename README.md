# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of the most important algorithms along with Python implementation that all software engineers should know. The algorithms are organized into the following categories:

- L01: Bitwise operations
- L02: String and Array
- L03: Tree and Graph
- L04: Linked List
- L05: Heaps
- L06: Sorting and Searching
- L07: Dynamic Programming

Each algorithm is implemented in Python and includes a detailed explanation of its time and space complexity.

## Contributors

The main contributor of this repository is **Armin Norouzi**.

## Usage

To use the algorithms, simply import the relevant file from the repository. Each file includes a function that implements the algorithm, as well as a commented section that explains the algorithm's usage and input/output.

Please note that the repository is for educational and reference purposes only, and the algorithms should not be used in production without thorough testing and optimization.

## Contribution

If you have any suggestions or improvements to the current implementations, feel free to submit a pull request. We welcome all contributions that can help make this repository a valuable resource for software engineers.

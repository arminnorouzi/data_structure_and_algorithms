# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of the most important algorithms along with Python implementation that all software engineers should know. The algorithms are organized into the following categories:

* Bitwise
* Dynamic Programming
* Tree and Graph 
* Heaps
* Linked List
* Sorting and Searching (comming soon)
* String and Array (comming soon)


Each algorithm is implemented in Python and includes a detailed explanation of its time and space complexity.

## Contributors
The main contributor of this repository is **Armin Norouzi**.

## Usage
To use the algorithms, simply import the relevant file from the repository. Each file includes a function that implements the algorithm, as well as a commented section that explains the algorithm's usage and input/output.

Please note that the repository is for educational and reference purposes only, and the algorithms should not be used in production without thorough testing and optimization.

## Contribution
If you have any suggestions or improvements to the current implementations, feel free to submit a pull request. We welcome all contributions that can help make this repository a valuable resource for software engineers.

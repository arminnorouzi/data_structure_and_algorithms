    "## Bitwise operations in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Bitwise operations are a group of elementary operations that deal with a binary number's constituent bits. These operations include left shift, right shift, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These operations are used to efficiently manipulate bits at the bit level and can be applied to tasks like determining whether a particular bit is set or clearing a particular bit. Bitwise operations are particularly useful in low-level languages such as C and C++, but are also available in high-level languages such as Python. Here is the operator of bit manipulation in Python:\n",

    "\n",
    "The function finds the magic number by utilizing bit manipulation and a mathematical property of magic numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function starts by setting two variables, `pow` and `answer` to 1. The variable `pow` is used to keep track of the current power of 5, and `answer` is used to store the final magic number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then enters a `while` loop that runs as long as the value of `n` is greater than 0. Inside the while loop, `pow` is multiplied by 5 on each iteration. This is done to calculate the next power of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the last bit of n is set (i.e. if n & 1 evaluates to True), the current power of 5 stored in `pow` is added to the answer variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step of each iteration is to proceed to the next bit of `n` by using the bitwise right shift operator `n >>= 1` (or n = n/2). This effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the least significant bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the while loop finishes, the final magic number is stored in the `answer` variable, and the function returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this function is `O(log(n))` because the while loop runs for `log(n)` times. This is because for each iteration, it is checking the next bit of n, which doubles the number of bits being checked. The space complexity is `O(1)` because the function only uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.\n",

    "The function starts by initializing an empty list called result and a variable i as `1 << 31`. The variable `i` is used to check each bit of the decimal number, starting from the leftmost (most significant) bit. The left shift operator `<<` is used to shift the value of 1 to the 31th position (i = 10000000000000000000000000000000 in binary) so that it can be used to check the 31th bit of the decimal number.\n",

    "The function then enters a while loop which will continue until i becomes 0. Inside the while loop, the function uses the bitwise operator `&` to check whether the 31th bit of the decimal number is ON or OFF. The expression `n & i >= 1` checks whether the result of the bitwise `&` operator is greater than or equal to 1, which means that the 31th bit is ON. If the condition is true, the function appends \"1\" to the result list. If the condition is false, the function appends \"0\" to the result list instead.\n",

    "The function starts by calculating the bitwise XOR of a and b using the `^` operator. This operation compares each bit of the two numbers and if the bits are different, the corresponding bit in the result is set to `1`, otherwise it is set to `0`. For example, if a is `5` (binary: `101`) and b is `3` (binary: `011`), the XOR result will be 6 (binary: `110`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then initializes a variable called `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of bits that differ between the two integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the function enters a while loop which continues until the `xor_result` is nonzero. Inside the loop, the function increments the `count` variable by `1` if the least significant bit (LSB) of the `xor_result` is 1. This can be achieved by using `xor_result & 1` to check the LSB. Then it will shift the xor_result to right by 1 bit to check the next bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the above code is `O(n)`, where n is the number of bits that differ between the two integers. The while loop will continue until all the bits of the xor_result have been checked. If the two integers have k different bits, the loop will run k times, resulting in a time complexity of `O(k)`. Since `k <= n` , the time complexity is `O(n).`\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the above code is `O(1)`. The function only uses a single variable called count to keep track of the number of bits that differ between the two integers. This variable takes a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input integers. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(1)`.\n",

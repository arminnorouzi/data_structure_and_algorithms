    "A **linked list** is a data structure that is commonly used in computer programming. It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a piece of data and a reference (or a \"pointer\") to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are useful for representing sequences of data where the order of the data is important, but where the actual physical arrangement of the data in memory is not important. This is because linked lists can be easily modified to insert, delete or rearrange elements in constant time, regardless of the size of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of linked lists over other data structures such as arrays is that they can be used to build more complex data structures. For example, linked lists are used to implement stacks, queues, and hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists come in different variations, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node has only one pointer to the next node in the list. In a doubly linked list, each node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node. In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "Here is an example schematic of a singly linked list structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "`| 1 | -> | 2 | -> | 3 | -> | 4 | -> NULL`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in the linked list has a value and a next pointer that points to the next node in the list. The last node in the list has a next pointer that points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example schematic of a doubly linked list structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "`NULL <--> | 1 | <--> | 2 | <--> | 3 | <--> | 4 | <--> NULL`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in the doubly linked list has a value, a prev pointer that points to the previous node in the list, and a next pointer that points to the next node in the list. The first node in the list has a prev pointer that points to NULL, indicating the beginning of the list, and the last node in the list has a next pointer that points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.\n"

    "4. Insert the new node between the found node and its next node (if any). Once the correct position is found, the code updates the links to insert the new node into the linked list. The `new_node.next` is set to `current.next` to maintain the remaining linked list after the insertion. Then, `current.next` is set to `new_node` to insert the new node between `current` and `current.next`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space and time complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the sorted_insert function depends on the position where the new node is to be inserted in the sorted linked list. In the best case, when the new node is to be inserted at the beginning of the list, the time complexity is `O(1)`. In the worst case, when the new node is to be inserted at the end of the list or the list is unsorted, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.\n",
